# Zero-Shot-MLaaS-Composition
Abstract	Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) composition enables IoT environments to combine multiple pre-trained models to meet diverse requirements. However, predicting the performance of a new service combination remains a critical challenge without manual evaluation. To address this, we propose a Zero-Shot MLaaS composability (ZSMC) model that predicts the performance of new or unseen service combinations without manual integration. Instead of relying on exhaustive exploration, the model estimates and learns the underlying relationships between existing composed services and unseen services. The ZSMC model generalizes beyond previously observed compositions, significantly reducing computation time for IoT environments. Extensive evaluations across multiple datasets show that the proposed ZSMC model achieves an R2 score of 0.93 and 22% average MAPE in predicting MLaaS composition performance. Moreover, the ZSMC model achieves an 80% reduction in computation time compared with manual composition.
