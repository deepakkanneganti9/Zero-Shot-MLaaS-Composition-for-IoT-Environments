# Zero-Shot-MLaaS-Composition
Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) has enabled Internet of Things (IoT) environments to access pre-trained machine learning (ML) models without developing from scratch. Beyond inference capabilities, MLaaS allows IoT environments to compose multiple services to meet diverse requirements. However, predicting the performance of the MLaaS compositions without manually composing them remains a critical challenge. Traditional service composition approaches and conventional ML techniques primarily focus on determining the composability between ,services but often fail to predict the performance of these compositions. To address this, the paper introduces a zero-shot composability (ZSC) model to predict the performance of new or unseen service combinations without manual integration. Instead of relying on exhaustive exploration, the model leverages estimate and learn the underlying relationships between existing compost services and unseen services. The ZSC model enables generalization beyond previously observed compositions, significantly reducing the computation time for IoT environments. Extensive evaluations across various datasets shows that the proposed ZSC model achieves an R² score of 0.93 and 22\% average MAPE and in performance prediction. Moreover, the ZSE model achieves a 40–60\% reduction in computation time compared with existing state-of-the-art methods techniques.
